My name is Michael Gattozzi. I'm a CS Undergrad at Umass Boston. I work

Haskell in production! In my spare time I write a lot Rust code and
lately I've been bridging the gap between the two.

Tech Interests include:

  - Blockchain Technology
  - Machine Learning
  - Distributed Systems
  - Haskell
  - Rust <3
  - Python
  - Arch Linux
