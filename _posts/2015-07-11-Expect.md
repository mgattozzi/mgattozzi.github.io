Let's face it unwrap() is really nice for writing quick dirty code in Rust.
There are times when we just know as the programmer that we will always get
something, Result and Option be damned. However, what if we're wrong? Look at
the following code (an excerpt from my shell code):

{% highlight rust %}
pub fn check_alias(input: Vec<&str>) -> Option<String> {
    //Checks if alias is in config file and returns the altered
    //version as an Option of the input. If succesfully found
    //it can be unwraped for execution

    //Makes sure there is something to execute
    if input.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    //Sets the alias to check for
    let alias_key = input.get(0).unwrap();

    //Check the config file for the key
    let config = read_in_config();
    let mut parsed = toml::Parser::new(&config).parse().unwrap();
    let alias_table = parsed.remove("alias")
        .expect("Add an [alias] field to your config");
    let alias = alias_table.lookup(alias_key);

    //Checks if alias is in config file
    if !alias.is_some() {
        return None;
    }
    let output: String = toml::decode(alias.unwrap().to_owned()).unwrap();
    Some(output)
}
{% endhighlight %}

I count four uses of unwrap() within that function. What if I'm testing this
code out and for some reason it panics. All I know is that I unwrapped a None
or Err type. I don't know which one it is, nor do I know how to go about fixing
it until I find out which unwrap() messed it up. How could this be avoided in
the future and made easier to pinpoint? I surely don't want to give up the
convenience of unwrap() in places where I feel sure the code won't mess up, yet
having a safety net in place would save me in the future in case Rust's std
library or something I use changes the way it operates.

Enter the expect() function.

###Expecting possible failure
Recently Rust Nightly added the ability for Result types to use expect() not
just Option types. Let's edit the above snippet to use expect() instead of
unwrap():

{% highlight rust %}
#![feature(result_expect)] //Necessary for results to use at present time
//Other code to make the function work since line above is at top of file
pub fn check_alias(input: Vec<&str>) -> Option<String> {
    //Checks if alias is in config file and returns the altered
    //version as an Option of the input. If succesfully found
    //it can be unwraped for execution

    //Makes sure there is something to execute
    if input.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    //Sets the alias to check for
    let alias_key = input.get(0).expect("Somehow there was no input");

    //Check the config file for the key
    let config = read_in_config();
    let mut parsed = toml::Parser::new(&config).parse()
		.expect("No config available");
    let alias_table = parsed.remove("alias")
        .expect("Add an [alias] field to your config");
    let alias = alias_table.lookup(alias_key);

    //Checks if alias is in config file
    if !alias.is_some() {
        return None;
    }
    let output: String = toml::decode(alias.expect("Should be available alias")
		.to_owned())
		.expect("Should decode value into a string");
    Some(output)
}
{% endhighlight %}

It didn't take that much work and still does the same thing as unwrap() with
the added benefit that if it fails I know exactly which expect() call to blame
and from there I can figure out the source of the error. This makes the code
slightly more robust and a better choice than unwrap() in one's code if hunting
down a bug that occurs later on. The payoff is worth the extra few keystrokes.
Especially in code bases with thousands of lines of code.

###Conclusion
Unless doing a quick example for someone with snippets of code one should opt
to use expect() over unwrap() as it'll allow for more robust code and easier
debugging.
