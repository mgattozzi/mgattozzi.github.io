title: Mac vs PC vs Linux
---

I've seen a lot of people over the years ask what should I get for development? Mac or Windows or Linux? Which is best? Understandable questions when you're starting out. What is the platform that will be the best investment for you to code on?

That's what this guide is for in helping you discern what you need. Full disclosure I'm a big Linux guy myself, but I know what's best for what platform. If you feel like I might be a bit biased on something shoot me an email to mgattozzi@gmail.com and I'll try to be a little less so if your argument is sound.

That being said lets dig into this

#Windows

##Pros
Most people's first thought for development isn't Windows. Usually they'll give it the nickname Winblows or something else but it has reasons to develop on it. If you plan on programming in C# or anything with the .NET platform then Windows is perfect for it since this is the platform they're targeted for as languages or frameworks. Visual Code Studio is only available on Windows and this IDE provides all the nice bells and whistles for the languages. Cost wise it's also cheaper than Mac since you can get a refurbished laptop for around 200 or 300 dollars and have it be a solid investment. Windows 10 is also getting an update in the future that will allow you to have Linux on Windows so you can run Linux programs on Windows. Perfect if you need to do any ssh stuff or other Linux/Unix based things that Windows doesn't have good support for. Currently this feature is only available in the preview build but should be released this year (2016). The other benefit is most people have used and are comfortable with it so you aren't hitting a learning curve with understanding how the OS works. It just works.

##Cons
If you want to develop in any other language besides maybe web development you're limited to what tools are available on Windows. A lot of good debugging tools like gdb or other profiling tools for your code like valgrind are limited to Linux. Which means you'd have to install Linux on Windows. If you find yourself using this Windows 10 feature often might be better off switching to Linux permanently. That being said it's not mandatory. As long as you're comfortable with it.

#Mac

##Pros
All the good design tools like Photoshop, After Effects, or any other multimedia based things are heavily supported on Mac! On top of that it's Unix based so it's simmilar to Linux in that you easily have tools that work on the command line without installing a compatability layer. The design of a Mac is also pretty slick if that's more of what you want in a computer. It's fairly easy to setup a development environment on for tasks and as a platform has gained popularity in developing on it so a lot of early code dependency things have been ironed out a bit for the platform.You also have tech support available from the Apple Store if things go badly.

##Cons
In order to get good development packages you'll have to install macports or homebrew since Mac doesn't have an inherently available package manager like Linux. There's also the cost. A new Mac Book costs a pretty penny and honestly you're paying for middle of the ground hardware. Macs are fast because they've been optimized insanely for the hardware but when compiling you'll find yourself limited by the systems hardware. That being said it'll run decently enough for most cases. Just know that the cost to power ratio is higher compared to Linux or Windows.

#Linux

##Pros
Most servers in the world run it, most developers you'll meet run it, and most software development is setup for and done on Linux. The software is free and there's all kinds of variations of Linux for users of a beginner level all the way up to Unix Wizard status. It gives you a degree of control over your system that is unparalleled by Mac or Windows (looks, packages etc.). Developing on this will be easier in the long run.

##Cons
No professional design tools like Photoshop which sucks if you use things like this for designing and coding websites. Can have a steep learning curve if you've never used it before. You are the tech support. Google is your friend if things go badly. Choosing which distro can be overwhelming if you're new to it (I recommend Ubuntu to start with).

#Parting thoughts
Each platform has it's strengths and weaknesses but at the end of the day what matters is that you use a tool that works best for you. If you want a mac get a mac. If you want Linux get Linux. Same for Windows. Just do what feels comfortable, yet know what weaknesses and strengths you accept with choosing that platform.
